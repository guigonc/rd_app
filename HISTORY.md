####Iterations

1. In the first iteration the goal is to build a backend application using Ruby on Rails called __Contact Tracker__ and a Client application using React and Redux that saves the contacts in Contact Tracker. On this increment I am not planning to do the javascript lib yet.

2. Next step was to get the page views by set an identity cookie to the users and send the requests to __Contact Tracker__
